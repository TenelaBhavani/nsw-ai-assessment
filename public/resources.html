      <p><strong>Administrative Decision Making.</strong> Administrative decisions are usually made under legislation and are directed towards a particular person (or organisation). They are different from contractual and commercial decisions and policy and political decisions.</p>

      <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI).</strong> Is the ability of a computer system to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and making decisions. AI encompasses various specialised domains that focus on different tasks and includes automation.</p>

      <p><strong>Bias.</strong> In data, this means a systematic distortion in the sampled data that compromises its representativeness. In algorithms it describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes, such as privileging one arbitrary group of users over others.</p>

      <p><strong>Data Governance.</strong> Implementation of a set of policies, processes, structures, roles and responsibilities to ensure that an agency’s data is managed effectively and that it can meet its current and future business requirements.</p>

      <p><strong>Data Lifecycle.</strong> A data life cycle illustrates the stages of data management required over time, from the time of planning and creation to the time that data is either archived or destroyed.</p>

      <p><strong>Large language model (LLM).</strong> A specialised type of artificial intelligence that has been trained on vast amounts of text to understand existing content and generate original content.</p>

      <p><strong>Operational AI.</strong> Systems that have a real-world effect. The purpose is to generate an action, either prompting a human to act, or the system acting by itself. Operational uses of AI often work in real time (or near real time) using a live environment for their source data.</p>

      <p><strong>Significant Harm.</strong> Always context specific, a harm which leads to significant concerns. Example from NSW Department of Communities and Justice – “A child or young person is at risk of significant harm if the circumstances that are causing concern for the safety, welfare or wellbeing of the child or young person are present to a significant extent."</p>

    </div>

    <!-- RIGHT COLUMN -->
    <div class="space-y-4">

      <p><strong>Data Quality.</strong> Data quality is generally accepted as meaning “fitness for purpose”. It is a term used to describe a documented agreement on the representation, format, and definition for data.</p>

      <p><strong>Data use sensitivity.</strong> Means risks or considerations associated with data subjects themselves or use of data.</p>

      <p><strong>Elevated risk.</strong> Elevated risk involves systems influencing decisions with legal or similar level consequences, triggering significant actions, operating autonomously, using sensitive data, risking harm, and lacking explainability.</p>

      <p><strong>Generative AI.</strong> Is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.</p>

      <p><strong>Hallucination.</strong> A hallucination or artificial hallucination is a response generated by an AI which contains false or misleading information.</p>

      <p><strong>Harm.</strong> Means any adverse effects experienced by an individual (or organisation) including those which are socially, physically, or financially damaging.</p>

      <p><strong>Human Rights.</strong> Are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination.</p>

      <p><strong>Responsible Officer.</strong> These include the Officer who is responsible for: use of the AI insights / decisions; the outcomes from the project; the technical performance of the AI system; data governance.</p>

      <p><strong>Reversible harm.</strong> Means an adverse effect that can be reversed with some level of effort, cost and time.</p>

      <p><strong>Secondary Harm.</strong> Means any adverse effects experienced by an individual (or organisation) not directly engaged with the AI system, or a subsequent harm identified after an initial harm is experienced by an individual (or organisation) engaged with the AI system.</p>

        AI is a “use” of data identifying appropriate frameworks and controls.
        The ACS report
        <span class="underline">“Frameworks and Controls for Data Sharing”</span>
        identifies the example controls and methods to ensure that data is treated

        while ensuring maximum possible value from data sharing practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking a simple perspective, AI is a tool that operates on data.
        Many concerns about the appropriate use of AI relate to considerations
        across the lifecycle of data leading to its utilisation by AI.
        This includes the lack of controls associated with the products created
        from the use of data by AI, as well as concerns about the future use
        of the original data itself.
        The range of data products created by AI is very wide, from insights
        and alerts, to decisions or synthesised material.
        All however can be treated in similar ways within appropriately
        considered data sharing and use frameworks.

        There are many resources available to better understand risks, harms, and mitigations for AI. NSW is committed to collaborating with other states and jurisdictions to share knowledge and lessons learned, making this content available to NSW public servants. While most publicly available resources are dense in content, we encourage everyone to continue learning, applying, and sharing. Some publicly available resources that may assist in your learning and development:

      <ul class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-3">
        <li><strong> AI resources</strong> A valuable asset and resource for Australia, CSIRO has many AI-related resources. The link provided is to their published risk management tool
</li>
        <li><strong>OECD.AI resources.</strong> OECD.AI combines resources from across the OECD, partners and stakeholder groups to create a one-stop-shop for AI policymakers. There site includes a tools and metrics section for AI.

        <li><strong>Economic Forum resources.</strong>  Containing many valuable resources for managing risk, explanation of country frameworks and news. 
</li>
        <li><strong>NIST AI resources.</strong> The National institute of standards and technology, U.S Department of commerce. Provides many resources for A.I including risk management, standards and measures.
</li>
         <li><strong> Human Technology Institute.</strong> The University of Technology Sydney provide great research papers relevant to the AI challenges facing Australia. 
</li>
        <li><strong>Martin Institute for public policy.</strong> JMI is an independent, non-partisan policy institute with charitable status, working to ensure that government can more effectively harness expertise and evidence for the public good. 
</li>
        <li><strong>Ombudsman ADM resources. </strong> The NSW ombudsman resources regarding automated decision making, referenced in the self-assessment, are highly recommended. 
</li>
        <P>There are too many resources to list, if you come across AI risk management resources, you think would be very useful for NSW public servants to be aware of, please let us know.
